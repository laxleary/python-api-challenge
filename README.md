# python-api-challenge
Module 6 Challenge

The following code was developed solely by me, without assistance from other students, TAs, instructors, or tutors. Most code was developed using tools seen in class, with the following exceptions:
- HVPlot documentation was used to check how to add hover categories (though I later found this in an omitted exercise from class as well).
- Python documentation was used to check how to convert a timestamp to datetime format. 
- I used the internet to check the units for SI, since I did not remember to include the units = metric specification in the parameters for OpenWeatherAPI. 
- The documentation for both necessary APIs was carefully examined for how to inout parameters, bias, and queries appropriately.
