# Python API Challenge
## Module 6 Challenge 
### Overview

The included code uses the GeoApify and OpenWeatherMapAPI (with an assist from numpy.random and CityPy) to examine the relation between weather and proximity to the equator. Multiple regressions are carried out, comparing Latitude to variables such as Humidity, Maximum Temperature, and Wind Speed. These regression studies are followed with discussions of findings and trends in the WeatherPy.py document. In Vacation.Py, Geoviews and OpenWeatherMap combine to show humidity on a map using the data found in the WeatherPy document. A brief study of a subsample with ideal weather conditions is then conducted, and GeoApify PLaces is used to find hotels in these areas, with a HVPlot map provided.  

### Outside Sources
The following code was developed solely by me, without assistance from other students, TAs, instructors, or tutors. Most code was developed using tools seen in class, with the following exceptions:
- HVPlot documentation was used to check how to add hover categories (though I later found this in an omitted exercise from class as well).
- Python documentation was used to check how to convert a timestamp to datetime format. 
- I used the internet to check the units for SI, since I did not remember to include the units = metric specification in the parameters for OpenWeatherAPI. 
- The documentation for both necessary APIs was carefully examined for how to inout parameters, bias, and queries appropriately.
